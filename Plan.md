Concrete plan (incremental, low-risk)

Phase 1: Registry + MCP adapter
Add ToolRegistry + Tool interface.
Implement MCPAdapter using fastmcp; register tools from connected servers; unify errors and metadata.
Wire registry into your prebuilt agents (react.py, router.py, network.py, supervisor_team.py) via DI.

Phase 2: Composio adapter
Implement ComposioAdapter with auth bootstrap, list/invoke, and per-tool scopes.
Add a policy layer (allow/deny, max_usage_count) and metrics.

Phase 3: LangChain adapter (selective)
Start with a small set: Tavily, Requests, Playwright, SQLDatabase, Slack/Gmail.
Lazy-load modules to keep footprint lean; map their input schemas to JSON Schema.

Phase 4: Native essentials
Local File Read/Write (sandboxed), HTTP fetch, Python REPL/DF helper, and a minimal RAG helper.
Add tests/examples to prove agent-tool loops.

Phase 5: UX and governance
Config: enable/disable providers, precedence, per-agent tool scopes, budgets.
Discovery command to print available tools per provider.
Redaction of secrets in logs, structured telemetry.


How it fits your prebuilt agents
react.py, guarded.py, plan_act_reflect.py: Choose tools via registry descriptions and tags, relying on your existing prompt/tool selection logic.
router.py, network.py: Use capability tags to branch to the correct tools/providers.
rag.py: Keep native RAG; optionally support MCP/Composio vector stores later.
swarm.py, supervisor_team.py: Per-agent tool scopes via registry policy to keep teams safe.
Acceptance criteria
List/discover tools from MCP servers and Composio accounts; show consistent metadata.
Invoke tools across all three providers with uniform request/response and error shape.
Policy enforcement (usage caps, allow/deny) plus timeouts and basic retries.
Minimal native tools work without external providers for local dev.
Examples: one notebook per provider + one multi-provider demo with a prebuilt agent.
If you want, I can draft the scaffolding for:

A provider-agnostic Tool interface and ToolRegistry
MCPAdapter (fastmcp) with discovery + invoke
ComposioAdapter stub
LangChainAdapter stub with a Tavily example
A small example wiring into react.py
Say the word and Iâ€™ll implement Phase 1 in this branch and run tests.
