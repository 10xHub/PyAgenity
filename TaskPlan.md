## Task 13: Async Pattern Standardization
- [ ] Audit sync/async usage patterns
- [ ] Create guidelines for sync vs async usage
- [ ] Convert remaining sync operations to async where appropriate
- [ ] Document when to use sync vs async

## Task 14: Dependency Injection Review
Dependency Injection is optional, if user want to use it, they can, but for simple user cases, it should not be mandatory (Already implemented this way)
Note: Already available in examples/react-di
You can check examples/react/react_sync.py for a simple example without DI
- [ ] Evaluate InjectQ usage for simple use cases
- [ ] Create simpler API for basic scenarios
- [ ] Document DI patterns and best practices
- [ ] Consider optional DI for advanced users only

- [ ] Create pull request templates
- [ ] Add code of conduct
- [ ] Create community discussion forum

## Task 16: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile graph execution for bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize message serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Implement object pooling for frequently created objects
- [ ] Add lazy loading for tool schemas
- [ ] Cache tool metadata to reduce overhead


<!-- ## Task 12: Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] Add metrics collection for graph execution time
- [ ] Implement node execution duration tracking
- [ ] Add error rate metrics
- [ ] Create metrics export for Prometheus/StatsD
