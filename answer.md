Currently, we are working with large proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, which typically have billions to trillions of parameters. In the medical domain, we have experimented with models like MedGemma (4B parameters), but found them insufficient for our specialized needs. As we transition to developing our own models, we plan to train domain-specific LLMs optimized for our agentic AI products, particularly in the medical sector, with sizes tailored to our computational resources and performance needs.

To leverage the program's resources, infrastructure, and expertise to develop and train our own specialized large language models (LLMs) in two key domains: medical applications and recruitment processes with an education focus. We aim to build domain-specific AI models that can enhance medical diagnostics, research, and patient care, while also improving recruitment workflows through better educational qualification assessment and skill matching.
